For the final round, things are very different: it’s a quick fire round. This round is all about thinking on your feet, so you can’t really prepare for it. 

You will be presented with a series of topics, and you’ll have to start talking about a possible solution to that problem that is as ridiculous as you can make it. Your aim is to talk for 1 minute each time. 

Here’s an idea of the kinds of things that might come up:

- *What should we do to make slow-moving people hurry up?*
- *What should be done about smartphone addiction?*
- *What should we do to stop anti-social behaviour?*
- *How should we fix fake news?*
- *How do we make cyclists better?*
- *Is their anything we can do to end “Blue Monday”?*
- *If you could introduce a new tax, what would it be for?*

(It’s not an exhaustive list.)

## Scoring 

In this round, you can’t lose points but there are lots of bonus points available.

You will be scored on the following criteria:

- how good your presentation is
- the originality of the solution

Each of these criteria are scored on a scale of 0 to +5 points.

In this round, you will gain points if:

- your presentation is good
- you come up with an interesting, funny, or very practical solution to the problems you’re presented with

You gain an additional point for each second that you keep talking without hesitating or repeating yourself, up to 60 additional points per problem.
