excerpt: Before we get into the meat of the podcast, you will need to introduce yourself. This what you will be asked.

Each episode starts by introducing the podcast, the host and the guests (in this case, you!). This bit should be pretty easy: you just need to talk about yourself! 

In the introduction, you’ll be asked:

1. who you are
2. what you do for a living
3. a really bad idea you’ve had recently in your everyday life

To help you come up with the ‘bad idea you’ve had’, here are some prompts:
	
1. Have you recently bought something you really shouldn’t have?
2. Have you recently done some DIY that has gone very wrong?
3. Did you recently commit to doing something and now you really regret it?

Once this part of the podcast is finished, we’ll move on to round 1: [The Impossible Implementation Unit](/guest-guides/impossible-implementation-unit).
