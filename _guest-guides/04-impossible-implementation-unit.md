For the first round, you will be given a public policy problem ahead of time. It might be a real problem or it might be a totally fictitious one. During recording, you have 5 minutes to pitch your solution to that problem. 

**For the first round only**, the solution to this problem needs to be:

1. totally unrealistic and very difficult — if not impossible — to implement, and 
2. something people would vote for even though it’s difficult. 

**You should prepare your 5 minute pitch in advance.** You can present your idea in any way you like[^1]. At the end of your presentation I will ask you questions for a few minutes about your idea. 

[^1]: Don’t forget it’s an audio-based podcast — it is possible to share slides or documents in the podcast feed too if you’d like to add a little extra panache!

## Scoring

Once you have finished your presentation, I will give you a score. You will be scored on the following criteria:

- how good your presentation is
- the originality of the idea
- how practical the idea is
- whether I would personally vote for it

Each of these criteria are scored on a scale of -5 to +5 points. 

In this round, you gain points if:

1. your presentation is *good*
2. your idea *is* original
3. your idea *won’t* work
4. and I *would* personally vote for it. 

However, if your presentation is *bad*, the idea *isn’t* very original, it’s *very easy* to make work, and I *wouldn’t* vote for it, then you’ll lose points.
