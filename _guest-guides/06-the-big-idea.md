For the third round, we mix things up a bit more. This time, you get to pick your own public policy problem to solve. You can choose a real problem or make up a totally fictitious scenario. During recording, you have 5 minutes to explain your problem and to pitch your solution to that problem. 

**For the third round only**, the solution to this problem should be the best one you can come up with. It needs to be:

1. actually deliverable, and 
2. something people would probably vote for.

**You should prepare your 5 minute pitch in advance.** You can present your idea in any way you like[^1]. At the end of your presentation I will ask you questions for a few minutes about your idea. 

[^1]: As before, don’t forget it’s an audio-based podcast — it is possible to share slides or documents in the podcast feed too if you’d like to add a little extra panache!

## Scoring

Once you have finished your presentation, I will give you a score. You will be scored on the following criteria:

- how good your presentation is
- how interesting the problem is
- the originality of the solution
- how practical the solution is
- whether I would personally vote for it

Each of these criteria are scored on a scale of 0 to 10 points. There are 50 points available in this round.

In this round, you will gain points if:

1. your presentation is *good*
2. you come up with an interesting problem
3. your solution *is* original
4. your solution *will* work
5. and I *would* personally vote for your solution

However, if your presentation is *bad*, the problem *isn’t* very interesting, the idea to solve it *isn’t* very original and is *very difficult* to make work, and I *wouldn’t* vote for it, then you’ll lose points.
