At its most simple, the Department of Bad Ideas is a gameshow. That means that, for every episode, we need contestants. 

If you think you are great at coming up with bonkers solutions to ridiculous and complex problems, then now is your chance to prove it. That's right; you can be a contestant on this very odd pod. 

If you want to be on the Department of Bad Ideas, all you have to do is get in touch. You can do that via Twitter -- [@PodofBadldeas](https:/www.twitter.com/podofbadideas) -- or via email at [podcast&#64;johnpe.art](mailto:podcast&#64;johnpe.art). 

If there's a slot available on an upcoming episode, then you're hired! 

## What you need to know

**You’ll need to be available for around 1 hour to record the episode.** This might be after work on a weekday, or on a weekend. We can schedule around your availability and mine.

**As a contestant on the podcast, you’ll need to do a little bit of homework in advance.** You’ll need to prepare three, five-minute pitches ahead of the recording. You can present however you like, but remember it’s an audio podcast. You can [find more information about the format of the show in this blog post](/posts/2019/01/30/introducing-department-of-bad-ideas/).

**Appearing on the show is unpaid and voluntary**. I’m not making any money from producing this podcast at all, and so I can’t pay you either. This is just for fun. If that changes, then I’ll agree a fair amount for your time with you.

**Recording takes place in London.** That’s where I’ll be, and I’ll need to record you. Again, I can’t pay for your travel — this is just for fun and I’m not making money from it.

**Anything we record will be published on the internet.** If you’re not comfortable with that, please don’t put yourself forward. The podcast will be edited, so if you fluff your pitches or want to try again during the recording session, that’s fine. I reserve the right to not use content if it’s of a poor quality, or I think it’ll get me or you into trouble.

**If you want to do it with someone else, you can.** Just let me know who you both are, and we can sort it out. You’d both need to prepare your own content, and can compete in a head-to-head episode.
