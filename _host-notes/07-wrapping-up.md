After all 4 rounds have been completed, it is time to add up the scores.

## Start to wrap up the podcast

Explain that the gameshow is now finished. Say something like:

> “That’s the last round completed. 

Move on to total up the scores. Say something like:

> “It’s now time to total up your scores and see how you did.”

## Recap the scores from rounds 1 to 3

There are 20 points available in each of Round 1, Round 2 and Round 3; so 60 points in total. Say something like:

> “In each of the first three rounds there were 20 points up for grabs.
> 
> “In the Impossible Implementation Unit, you scored *[insert points]*.
> 
> “In the Unsaleable Policy Division, you scored *[insert points]*.
> 
> “For your Big Idea, you scored *[insert points]*.
> 
> “That gives you a total of *[insert points]* out of a possible 60 points”

## Recap the scores from the final round

There are 70 points available for each of the problems posed in the final round; so 280 points available in total. Say something like:

> “In our final quick fire round there are a potential 280 points up for grabs.
> 
> “You scored *[insert points]*.”

## Add up the scores

There are 340 points available across all rounds. Ask the contestant how they feel about their performance. Say something like:

> “That means your total points are *[insert points]* out of a possible 340. Congratulations. How do you feel?
> 
> “Points mean absolutely nothing. At least you can now go away and gloat about your policy making prowess.”
