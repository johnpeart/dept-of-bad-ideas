For the second round, the guest will have been given a public policy problem ahead of time. It might be a real problem or it might be a totally fictitious one. During recording, they have 5 minutes to pitch your solution to that problem. At the end of the presentation, the host will ask questions for a few minutes about the idea.

**For the second round only**, the solution to this problem needs to be:

1. actually deliverable and preferably grounded in some evidence (if you can find any!), and
2. something people would never vote for in a million years

## Explain how the second round works

Introduce the *Unsaleable Policy Division* and explain what the guest has to do. Say something like:

> “For our second round you’ll be taking up a role in our *Unsaleable Policy Division*. The job of this unit is to come up with solutions that might actually work but that people would never vote for in a million years.
> 
> “You’ve been given a policy problem in advance of us recording today’s episode and you were asked to prepare a 5 minute presentation about how you would solve that problem.”

## Explain the policy problem

Tell listeners what the problem is that the guest has been asked to solve. Say something like:

> “The problem you’ve been asked to solve is: *[read out the problem]*
> 
> “Are you ready to pitch your solution?”

## Guest presentation 

The guest will present for 5 minutes.

## Follow up questions

When the guest has finished presenting, ask them some follow up questions for a few minutes to clarify content of their idea, or just to draw out anything interesting or funny.

## Scoring

Explain how this round is scored. Say something like:

> “Time for your scores. In the *Unsaleable Policy Division*, employees get marked in four areas: presentation, originality, practicality and electoral viability.
> 
> “You get high marks if:
> 1. your presentation is *good*
> 2. your solution *is* original
> 3. your solution *would* work
> 4. and I *wouldn’t* personally vote for it

Mark the guest on a scale of `-5` to `+5` for each of these criteria.

## Move on to Round 3

Once this part of the podcast is finished, we’ll move on to round 3: [The Big Idea](/host-notes/the-big-idea).
