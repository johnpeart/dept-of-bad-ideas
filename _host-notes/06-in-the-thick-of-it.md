For the final round, things are very different: it’s a quick fire round. This round is all about guests thinking on their feet, so they can’t really prepare for it. 

## Explain how the final round works

Introduce *In the Thick of It* to the guest and explain how it works. Say something like:

> “Now it’s time to throw you “Into the Thick of It” for our final round. This round is a quick-fire round.
> 
> “I’m going to give you a series of problems that you haven’t seen in advance, and your job is to solve that problem on the fly. The aim is for you to talk for 1 minute without hesitation or repetition.

## Scoring 

Explain how the scoring works for this round. Say something like:

> “For every second you keep talking without hesitation or repetition, you gain a point. You get up to 10 extra points if your solution is either very funny, very practical or very original.
> 
> “You’ll be asked to solve four problems, meaning there are up to 280 points on offer in this round.”

## Move on to the final scoring

Once this part of the podcast is finished, we’ll move on to the final scores.
