For the third round, the guest will choose their own public policy problem ahead of time. It might be a real problem or it might be a totally fictitious one. During recording, they have 5 minutes to pitch your solution to that problem. At the end of the presentation, the host will ask questions for a few minutes about the idea.

**For the third round only**, the solution to this problem needs to be:

1. actually deliverable, and
2. something people would probably vote for

## Explain how the third round works

Introduce *the Big Idea* and explain what the guest has to do. Say something like:

> “For our third round you’ll be pitching *The Big Idea*. Your job is to come up with solutions that might actually work and that people would actually vote for.
> 
> “You’ve chosen your own problem to solve and you were asked to prepare a 5 minute presentation about how you would solve that problem.”

## Ask what their idea is

As the guest to explain their problem. Say something like:

> “What is the problem you’ve decided to fix?”

## Guest presentation 

Invite the guest to present their solution.

The guest will present for 5 minutes.

## Follow up questions

When the guest has finished presenting, ask them some follow up questions for a few minutes to clarify content of their idea, or just to draw out anything interesting or funny.

## Scoring

Explain how this round is scored. Say something like:

> “Time for your scores. For your big idea, you get marked in five areas: presentation, idea, originality, practicality and electoral viability.
> 
> “You get high marks if:
> 1. your presentation is *good*
> 2. your idea *is* interesting
> 3. your solution *is* original
> 4. your solution *would* work
> 5. and I *would* personally vote for it”

Mark the guest on a scale of `-5` to `+5` for each of these criteria.

## Move on to Round 4

Once this part of the podcast is finished, we’ll move on to round 4: [In the Thick of It](/host-notes/in-the-thick-of-it).
