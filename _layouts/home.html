				<p>Each episode of the <strong>Department of Bad Ideas</strong> consists of three rounds.</p>
				
				<h2>Unsaleable Policy Division</h2>
						
				<p>In round one, guests are given a real policy problem, and they're asked to come up with a working policy solution. But there's a catch: it has to be completely unsellable. It has to be so good that any minister would recoil in horror at the very idea of fixing that problem with that particular solution.</p>
				
				<p>Points are awarded for <strong>presentation</strong>, <strong>practicality</strong> and <strong>unsaleability</strong>.</p>
					
				<h2>Impossible Implementation Unit</h2>
				
				<p>In the second round, our guests are given another real issue to solve, but this time things are different: the solution has to be electoral gold, but entirely impossible to implement.</p>
						
				<p>Points are awarded for <strong>presentation</strong>, <strong>practicality</strong> and <strong>saleability</strong>.</p>
					
				<h2>In The Thick Of It</h2>
				
				<p>The final round is a quick fire round, inspired by the hit radio show, <em>Just a Minute</em>. We'll give our guests a policy problem, and they have to describe a solution to it, on the fly, for a minute without repetition, hesitation or deviation. If they falter, their opponent takes over and the clock keeps ticking.</p>
				
				<p>Points are awarded to who ever is still talking at the end of the minute.</p>
